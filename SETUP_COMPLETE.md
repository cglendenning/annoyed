### Option 1: Fix in Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. In Xcode:
   - Click **"Runner"** in the left sidebar (the blue project icon)
   - Select **"Runner"** under TARGETS
   - Go to **"Build Settings"** tab
   - Search for **"iOS Deployment Target"**
   - Change from `26.0` to **`13.0`**
   - Press `Cmd+S` to save

3. Close Xcode and run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Option 2: Try Android Instead
If you have Android Studio or an Android device/emulator:
```bash
flutter run
# Select Android device when prompted
```

## üì± Once the iOS Issue is Fixed

### Test the Complete Flow:

   - Set preferred hours (10:00 - 19:00)

3. **Test Capture Mode:**
   - Hold the record button
   - Speak an annoyance (e.g., "My neighbor's leaf blower woke me up at 6 AM")
   - Release to save
   - Watch it get transcribed and categorized

4. **Create 3 entries** to see the Pattern Report

5. **Test Coach Mode:**
   - For testing, you can manually trigger by navigating to Coach Prompt screen
   - (Or wait for scheduled notification - requires Cloud Scheduler setup)

6. **Check Firestore Console:**
