# Anonymous to Email Authentication Flow

## 🎯 User Journey

### Phase 1: Anonymous Start (0-4 annoyances)
1. **First Launch** → Intro screen → Tap "Get Started"
2. **Automatic anonymous sign-in** (Firebase Auth anonymous)
3. **Tutorial** → **Permissions** → **Home Screen**
4. User records 1-4 annoyances freely, no email required
5. Can access coaching, history, all features

### Phase 2: Auth Gate (5th annoyance)
1. User records their **5th annoyance**
2. After "✓ Saved" message, see:
   ```
   🎉 You're on a roll!
   
   You've recorded 5 annoyances. Sign up now to 
   unlock coaching insights and keep your progress forever!
   ```
3. **Benefits shown:**
   - ✅ Keep all your recorded annoyances
   - ✅ Get AI-powered coaching insights
   - ✅ Sync across all your devices
   - ✅ Access exclusive deals from Coach Craig

4. **Two buttons:**
   - "Sign Up & Keep My Data" (primary, gradient)
   - "Already have an account? Sign In" (text button)

### Phase 3: Account Linking
1. User enters email + password
2. Agrees to Terms & Privacy Policy
3. Optionally opts into marketing (🎁 Exclusive Perks!)
4. Tap "Create Account"
5. **Firebase links anonymous account to email/password**
6. **All data preserved!** (same uid, all annoyances kept)
7. User continues with full account

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Firebase Auth Flow
```javascript
// Step 1: Anonymous sign-in (onboarding)
await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInAnonymously();
// uid: "abc123xyz" (anonymous)

// Step 2: User records 5 annoyances
// All stored with uid: "abc123xyz"

// Step 3: Link to email/password
final credential = EmailAuthProvider.credential(email, password);
await user.linkWithCredential(credential);
// uid: STILL "abc123xyz" (now permanent!)
// All annoyances automatically stay with same uid
```

### Key Files

**`lib/screens/auth_gate_screen.dart`**
- Beautiful gradient screen shown after 5th annoyance
- Lists benefits of signing up
- Routes to EmailAuthScreen with `isUpgrade: true`

**`lib/screens/email_auth_screen.dart`**
- Added `isUpgrade` parameter
- Calls `linkAnonymousToEmail()` instead of `signUpWithEmail()` when upgrading
- Shows different subtitle: "Keep your progress & unlock features"

**`lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`**
- New method: `linkAnonymousToEmail()`
- Uses `user.linkWithCredential()` to preserve uid
- Stores user doc with `upgradedFromAnonymous: true` flag

**`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`**
- After saving annoyance, checks:
  - `annoyanceCount == 5`
  - `user.isAnonymous == true`
- If both true, navigate to `AuthGateScreen`

**`lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`**
- "Get Started" button now calls `signInAnonymously()`
- Added "Already have an account? Sign In" link

## 📊 Data Flow

### Firestore Collections

**`annoyances/{docId}`**
```javascript
{
  uid: "abc123xyz",  // Same before & after upgrade
  transcript: "My coworker interrupts me",
  ts: timestamp,
  category: "relationships"
}
```

**`users/{uid}`** (created on upgrade)
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  marketingOptIn: true,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  acceptedTermsAt: timestamp,
  gdprConsent: true,
  upgradedFromAnonymous: true  // Flag for analytics
}
```

### No Data Migration Needed! ✅
Because the uid stays the same, all existing:
- Annoyances
- Coaching records
- Suggestions
- User preferences

...automatically stay associated with the account!

## 🎨 UX Benefits

1. **Frictionless Start**: Users try the app immediately
2. **Proof of Value**: Experience coaching before committing
3. **Low Barrier**: No email required to explore
4. **Timely Ask**: Request email after they're engaged (5 entries)
5. **No Data Loss**: "Keep My Data" messaging reassures users
6. **Exciting Benefits**: Marketing opt-in presented as exclusive perks

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

### What if user closes app before signing up?
- Anonymous session persists across app restarts
- Data saved locally and in Firestore with anonymous uid
- Gate shows again on 5th annoyance

### What if user tries to record 6th annoyance while anonymous?
- Currently: No blocker, they can continue
- **Optional**: You could block after 5 with: "Sign up to continue recording"
- **Recommended**: Let them continue, show gentle reminders

### What if user already has an account with that email?
- Firebase throws `email-already-in-use` error
- User sees: "This email is already registered. Try signing in."
- Can tap "Already have an account? Sign In" link

### What if user signs out after upgrading?
- They sign back in with email/password
- All data still there (permanent account now)

### What if user deletes app before signing up?
- Anonymous data is lost (expected behavior)
- Firestore will have orphaned docs with anonymous uid
- **Optional**: Set up Cloud Function to clean up old anonymous data

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance

### Anonymous Users
- **GDPR**: Anonymous users have no PII, so GDPR doesn't apply until upgrade
- **Data Storage**: Same Firebase security rules apply
- **Deletion**: Can still use "Delete all my data" in settings

### After Upgrade
- **Terms Acceptance**: Required checkbox before linking
- **Marketing Opt-in**: Explicit checkbox, not pre-checked
- **GDPR Rights**: Full rights apply (access, deletion, portability)
- **User Doc**: Stores consent timestamps

## 📈 Conversion Optimization

### Metrics to Track
- Anonymous sign-up rate (should be ~100%)
- 5th annoyance completion rate
- Email conversion rate at gate
- Time to 5th annoyance (faster = better engagement)
- Drop-off at auth gate

### A/B Testing Ideas
1. **Gate Timing**: Test 3rd vs 5th vs 7th annoyance
2. **Messaging**: "You're on a roll!" vs "Don't lose your progress!"
3. **Benefits**: Different benefit lists
4. **CTA**: "Sign Up" vs "Save My Progress" vs "Unlock Features"

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Option 1: Soft Nag
After 5th annoyance, show banner on home screen:
"💾 Sign up to save your progress (you have 5 annoyances)"

### Option 2: Hard Gate
Block recording after 5th annoyance until they sign up

### Option 3: Feature Lock
Allow unlimited annoyances, but lock coaching behind sign-up

### Option 4: Countdown
"Record 2 more annoyances to unlock coaching!" (gates coaching at 5)
