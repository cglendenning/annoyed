### 6. User Data Storage (Firebase)
When a user signs up, we store in Firestore (`users` collection):
```javascript
{
  email: string,
  marketingOptIn: boolean,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  acceptedTermsAt: timestamp,
  gdprConsent: true
}
```

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Firebase Security Rules
Add rules for the new `users` collection:

```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase Email/Password Auth
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication
2. Enable "Email/Password" sign-in method
3. Optional: Enable email verification (recommended)

### 3. Green Pyramid App Links
Updated with actual app URLs in `about_screen.dart`:
- **iOS**: `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/green-pyramid-your-best-life/id6450578276`
- **Android**: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cglendenning.life_ops&hl=en_US`

### 4. Marketing Email System
You'll need to set up a system to:
- Query Firestore for users where `marketingOptIn === true`
- Send emails via a service like SendGrid, Mailchimp, or Firebase Extensions
- Include unsubscribe links (legal requirement)

Recommendation: Use **Firebase Extensions > Trigger Email** with SendGrid

### 5. Data Protection Officer (GDPR)
The Privacy Policy mentions a Data Protection Officer for GDPR inquiries. If you're handling EU users at scale, consider:
- Designating yourself or someone as DPO
- Adding a contact email in the Privacy Policy

### 6. App Store Requirements
When submitting to App Store/Play Store:
- **Privacy Nutrition Label** (iOS): Disclose data collection
- **Data Safety** (Android): Disclose data practices
- Both stores require links to Privacy Policy and Terms

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Features

### Password Storage
- Firebase Auth handles password hashing (bcrypt)
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Never transmitted to your app code

### Data Encryption
- Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS
- Data at rest: Firebase encrypts at rest
- Voice recordings: Processed on-device, only text sent to Firebase

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

While this implementation follows best practices for U.S. and GDPR compliance, **I strongly recommend having a lawyer review your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy** before launching, especially if:
- You expect significant EU traffic

- You're monetizing with ads or selling data
- You're operating in regulated industries
