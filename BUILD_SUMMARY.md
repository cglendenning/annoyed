## 💰 Estimated Costs

### Development
- ✅ **Time:** 3 days (as designed)
- ✅ **Cost:** $0 (DIY)

### Ongoing
- **Firebase:** ~$0-25/month (Spark plan → Blaze as you grow)

## 📝 Notes

- All secrets are gitignored (`lib/secrets.dart`)
- Firebase config is gitignored (`firebase_options.dart`)
- RevenueCat keys from life_ops are already integrated
- OpenAI key from life_ops is already in `secrets.dart`
- Cloud Functions use same OpenAI key (set via Firebase config)
