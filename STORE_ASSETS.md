### 3. App Store Copy

#### Name
```
Annoyed
```

#### Tagline (iOS Subtitle)
```
Annoyed ‚Üí Aligned.
```

#### Short Description (Google Play, 80 chars)
```
Vent fast. Get your pattern after 3 entries. Then keep upgrading.
```

#### Long Description (Apple, 4000 chars; Google, 4000 chars)

```
Two modes. One mission: upgrade what annoys you.

CAPTURE MODE
Something sets you off? Open Annoyed and hold to record. Your voice note is transcribed on-device‚Äîaudio never leaves your phone‚Äîand categorized into one of five patterns: Boundaries, Environment, Systems Debt, Communication, or Energy.

No journaling tax. No long forms. Capture takes seconds.

COACH MODE
Once a day, at a varying time inside the hours you choose, Annoyed checks in: "Good moment for a suggestion?" If it isn't, tap "Not now." If it is, you receive exactly one concise suggestion tailored to your recent patterns.

Sometimes it's a mindset reframe that creates an immediate shift. Other times it's a specific daily behavior you can complete in under thirty minutes. Tap "HELL YES!" or "Meh" to train what you get next.

MAGIC AFTER 3
Within three entries, Annoyed shows you a simple pattern snapshot so you can see what's driving the friction. From there, the emphasis is on increasing suggestion quality.
