# Annoyed ‚Äî Personal Friction Coach

**Annoyed ‚Üí Aligned.**

A focused personal coach that meets you in two moments of your day: when something irritates you (Capture Mode) and when you're ready for a suggestion (Coach Mode).

## Features

### Capture Mode
- **Hold-to-record** voice capture (30s, on-device transcription)
- **Auto-categorization** into 5 patterns: Boundaries, Environment, Systems Debt, Communication, Energy
- **PII redaction** before any network call
- **Text fallback** if mic is unavailable

### Coach Mode
- **Daily suggestions** at random times within your preferred hours
- **Personalized coaching** based on your patterns
- **Quick feedback** (HELL YES / Meh) trains future suggestions
- **One action only** ‚Äî no overwhelm

### Privacy First
- Audio **never leaves your phone** (on-device transcription only)
- Client-side PII redaction
- User-controlled data deletion

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (iOS + Android)
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, FCM)
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for classification and suggestion generation
- **Payments:** RevenueCat for cross-platform subscriptions
